# HTML File Uploader to S3 and Returning S3 Path to Apache Kafka

This project aims to provide a solution for uploading HTML files to Amazon S3 and sending the S3 file path to Apache Kafka. 

Although I haven't written the parser file that consumes the Kafka message and downloads the S3 file, I have gained valuable knowledge on Apache Kafka, Amazon S3, and Docker throughout this project. 

The main motivation behind starting this project was to learn these technologies.
